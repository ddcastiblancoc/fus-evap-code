# fus-evap-code
This Python code calculates some physical quantities and all possible residues related to a fusion-evaporation nuclear reaction.

# Abstract
This article presents a study of fusion-evaporation nuclear reactions. Starting from a detailed description of the semi-classical theoretical framework behind this nuclear reaction, quantities such as the cross section of compound nucleus formation and various evaporation residues after its formation, as well as their cross sections (proportional to the events number), were estimated by means of a Python code. The code splits the compound nucleus formation process and its subsequent decay into several residual nuclei, which occurs as a sequential particle emission. In order to prioritize a first approximation theory, different nuclear models, with semi-classical and statistical origin, related to projectile-target fusion, light particle evaporation (n, p, $\upalpha$) and fission, were described in detail.
